# Ruffle

An extremely fast and accurate Python library for detecting toxic and harmful content in text using state-of-the-art transformer models.

## Highlights

- âš¡ **Lightning Fast**: Built on PyTorch Lightning for efficient training and inference
- ðŸ§  **Transformer-Powered**: Leverages BERT, DistilBERT, and other state-of-the-art models
- ðŸŽ¯ **Multi-Label Detection**: Simultaneously detects toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity_hate
- ðŸš€ **Production Ready**: Optimized inference pipeline with model compilation
- ðŸ”§ **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based configuration system for easy experimentation
- ðŸ“Š **Rich Monitoring**: Built-in progress tracking, logging, and model checkpointing

Ruffle provides both high-level prediction APIs for quick content moderation and comprehensive training tools for custom model development.

## Installation

Install Ruffle using uv (recommended):

```bash
uv add ruffle
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install ruffle
```

## Quick Start

### Content Moderation

Get started with toxicity detection in just a few lines:

```python
from ruffle import Ruffle

# Load a pre-trained model
detector = Ruffle(model_name="bert-tiny")

# Detect toxicity in text
result = detector.predict("This is a sample comment to analyze")
print(result)

# Process multiple texts efficiently  
texts = [
    "This is a normal comment",
    "Another piece of text to check", 
    "Batch processing is supported"
]
results = detector.predict(texts)

```

### CLI

Use Ruffle directly from the command line:

```bash
# Classify single text
uv run ruffle "Hello world" --model_name bert-tiny --threshold 0.7

# Classify multiple texts  
uv run ruffle '["Text 1", "Text 2"]' --model_name bert-tiny

# Use custom checkpoint
uv run ruffle "Sample text" --checkpoint_path model.ckpt
```

### Custom Model Training

Train your own toxicity detection model:

```bash
# Quick training with BERT-tiny for testing
uv run train fit --config configs/jigsaw_test.yaml

# Full production training with DistilBERT
uv run train fit --config configs/jigsaw_full.yaml

# Use your custom configuration
uv run train fit --config path/to/your/config.yaml
```

See the [documentation](https://ruffle.readthedocs.io) for comprehensive guides and API reference.

## Detection Categories

Ruffle detects six categories of toxicity based on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `toxic` | General toxicity and harmful content |
| `severe_toxic` | Severely toxic content requiring immediate action |
| `obscene` | Obscene language and explicit content |
| `threat` | Threatening language and intimidation |
| `insult` | Insulting and demeaning content |
| `identity_hate` | Identity-based hate speech and discrimination |

Example output:

```python
{
    "This is offensive content": {
        "toxic": 0.89,
        "severe_toxic": 0.23,
        "obscene": 0.67,
        "threat": 0.12,
        "insult": 0.78,
        "identity_hate": 0.34
    }
}
```

## Configuration

Ruffle uses YAML configuration files for reproducible training:

```yaml
# config.yaml
model:
  model_name: distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased
  max_token_len: 256
  lr: 3e-5
  warmup_epochs: 5
  cache_dir: data

data:
  data_dir: data/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge
  labels: [toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate]
  batch_size: 64
  val_size: 0.2

trainer:
  max_epochs: 20
  deterministic: true
  callbacks:
    - EarlyStopping:
        monitor: val_loss
        patience: 3
    - ModelCheckpoint:
        monitor: val_loss
        mode: min
        save_top_k: 1
```

See the [`configs/`](configs/) directory for complete examples.
